## This is my Todo App

This is a Todo App that is being brought to life with React and Semantic UI.

The project was done, although I did not feel that it was completely finished, so I am re-doing most of the functionality.

**What is done:**
1. You are able to see a Todo List, create new todo lists and todos inside them. 
1. Everything is split into seperate Todo Pages;

**What is currently in progress:**
1. The project currently does not save the Todos anywhere, so in the upcoming week, a JsonServer instance is going to be created;
1. Some components need to be refactored into functional components

### How to run?
1) Since this is an environment with npm etc., you can clone the rep;
2) Use npm install to install the dependencies (I use this boilerplate for my react projects);
3) Click on NPM start to see the results.
