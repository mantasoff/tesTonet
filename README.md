## This is my Todo App

This is a Todo App that is being brought to life with React and Semantic UI.

The project was done, although I did not feel that it was completely finished, so I am re-doing most of the functionality.

**What is done:**
1. You are able to see a Todo List, create new todo lists and todos inside them. 
1. Everything is split into seperate Todo Pages;
1. Todos are saved in a Json-Server;

**What is currently in progress:**
1. Some components need to be refactored into functional components

### How to run?
1. Since this is an environment with npm etc., you can clone the rep;
1. Setup a Json-Server. You can use the example in the folder named "jsonServerExample".
1. Start the Json-Server.
1. Use npm install to install the dependencies (I use this boilerplate for my react projects);
1. Click on NPM start to see the results.
